If there is one thing that is particularily important in Delta, it is a sense of community. Many may have a desire to contribute to the academic part of this community, especially teaching what they can to those who need it, but many need a little push over the threshold, or a little financial incentive. Delta's academic scholarship (DAS) aims to be this incentive, the little extra motivation to contribute to Delta's academic community.
